This is a project that implements neural networks using C++, BLAS, MKL and CUDA and observes the differences between their performances. In addition to this, we also use Python libraries such as Tensorflow for further implementations and comparisions for performance benchmarks.

This is the Python comparision graph for Native C++ implementation, BLAS, MKL and CUDA for matrix multiplication and vector addition.
